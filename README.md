sta_routes_updater Readme

This program downloads the PDF files that the Spokane Transit Authority updates three times a year when it makes its route service changes.  Those changes are made in January, May, and September.  With this program, all of those files can be downloaded automatically into the current working directory.  The PDF files that Spokane Transit puts on their website are PDF versions of the physical route information pamphlets that they provide on their buses and at their plazas.
